MIROCLS: Mid-IR Optics CLuster Search
This code searches for clusters in a 2-D data using density based algorithm OPTICS:
Ordering Points To Identify Clustering Structure.

Following is the description of submodules.




cluster_searcher.py: search for cluster using OPTICS algorithm
split_spitzer_data.py: split the data file to smaller tiles of 1deg x 1deg
visualizer.py: creates a pdf with NIR, MIR CMD and 3 channel images and a glimpse histogram


MIROCOLS.py: compiles all the modules as specified by the user.
